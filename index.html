  <h6><strong>They Convert</strong> is a monthly conversion rate optimization (CRO) service that continuously improves your website and gets you more revenue from your existing traffic.</h6>

<p>The odds are that your website is currently underperforming and not reaching it’s true potential.</p>

<p>There’s a variation of your website out there that could multiply your conversions three fold!</p>

<p>Just by adding improvements to the copy and design of your website, you can persuade more of your visitors to become customers and thus create major and lasting improvements to your sales and revenue.</p>

<p>But of course you know that don’t you … otherwise you wouldn’t be on this page.</p>

<p>But the real question is how do you come up with the better performing variation that produces the highest returns?</p>

<p>The answer is Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO). This process consists of comprehensively analyzing and testing parts of your business and website to make sure you’re getting the highest returns from your existing traffic.</p>

<p>If you’re not testing, you’re guessing …</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Testing works. If you&rsquo;re not doing it, you&rsquo;re missing out. Your website can (and should) get better. Every single day.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>– Seth Godin, Author &amp; Marketing Guru</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s difficult to figure this stuff out on your own. You’re too close, you’ve forgotten what it’s like to use your website for the first time.</p>

<p>You’d be surprised how many companies make important marketing decisions based on their own subjective opinions, egos and false assumptions.</p>

<p>But where do you start? What exactly do you need to test? How do you make sure that you’re doing it right? And how do you make sure there’s a real improvement from your testing efforts?</p>

<p>CRO may appear simple on the surface, but it requires multiple skillsets working together seamlessly. You can easily end up wasting a lot time by testing things that don’t matter and making zero gains or even losing money.</p>

<p>Copying the so called ‘best practices’ is not the way to go. Because what works for others may not work for you. </p>

<p>We’ve seen this many times.</p>

<p>But we can help you just like we’ve helped other companies in the same situation.</p>

<h3>We’ve developed a proven process that get’s results:</h3>

<p> <b>1. Evaluate </b></p>

<p>First we identify (not guess) which parts of your business are under-performing and why.</p>

<p>We analyse your analytics, your sales funnel, perform usability tests, talk to your customers, talk to your team and review your competition.</p>

<p>We look for your biggest leaks and find out why it’s happening.</p>

<p> <b>2. Plan </b></p>

<p>Next we create your optimization strategy based on the insights we gained from our analysis.</p>

<p>We develop a 6 month testing program. We write a list of A/B tests we want to perform, then prioritize it to pick the low hanging fruit first (biggest sources of improvement).</p>

<p> <b>3. Test </b></p>

<p>We run extensive A/B tests for you, tell you which variations perform better and make sure all the data is valid so you can be confident the new changes result in more sales. </p>

<p> <b>4. Rinse &amp; Repeat</b></p>

<p>After testing comes the review. Did the changes make a positive improvement? And how the improvement translates in actual dollar value?</p>

<p>If yes, great! We move onto the next area of the sales funnel that needs improving and start at the beginning of this process again.</p>

<p>If not, we dig deep into the results and uncover the reasons why. We then take these lessons and apply them as we start the process over again.</p>

<p>In reality, it’s rare to get big wins in just a few tests. With every result—good or bad—we learn more about your site and your customers, and this allows us to get the best results for you.</p>

<p>For every test, win or fail, we write up a full summary of the results and what they mean. You’re keep in the loop 100%.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what one of them has to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our site had been struggling with conversion and after numerous iterations and working with different web development firms we decided to hire David.
David did significant research on our competition and worked with us to immediately identify our key selling points and successfully position our story and product.
The landing page provided by David was of the highest quality we had seen in our space and included excellent copy.</em> <strong>We noticed an immediate increase in conversion after launching the page.</strong> 
<em>David was a pleasure to work with and we highly recommend David for any website conversion or optimization.&rdquo;</em> </p>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>

<h4>How long will each A/B test run for?</h4>

<p>We run each test for a minimum of 3-4 weeks regardless of traffic levels and conversion rates. This provides the highest possibility that any changes (positive or negative) the test results indicate will also occur if you make the changes permanent.</p>

<h4>How many A/B test tests will I get per month?</h4>

<p>We average 1-2 tests per month. Most tests are run for 3-4 weeks to ensure valid results. The number of tests we perform each month depends on the size and changes required for each test. </p>

<h4>How long before the first A/B test is live?</h4>

<p>During the second month. The first month is set aside for our extensive research process that enables us to create more winning tests than the industry average. It takes time to fully understand your business and customers, integrate with your technology, and evaluate your analytics (or setup/fix your analytics if required).</p>

<h4>Who will write the copy or create the designs when making the changes to my website?</h4>

<p>Copywriting, design and front end coding are all included when testing. If any updates require changes to the back end we’ll discuss this with you and plan the best course of action together. You’ll be responsible for taking the changes from winning tests and making them permanent in your website (you’ll have full access to all work we’ve created).</p>

<h4>What about whole website redesigns?</h4>

<p>Whole website redesigns are not included in our monthly fee, but we do provide conversion optimized redesigns as a service and are happy to provide you with a quote.</p>

<h4>Will the changes you make to our website be permanent?</h4>

<p>It will be your responsibility to take the changes from a winning test and implement then into your website. We will supply any designs and code we created for the test and are happy to work closely with your team to ensure the correct changes are made.</p>

<h4>What happens when we get a positive result from an A/B test?</h4>

<p>First we give each other a round of high fives … then we start a new test while you implement the changes from the winning test permanently into your website. Optimization is an ongoing process and there are many ways to increase your sales and revenue.</p>

<h4>How long will it take before I see results?</h4>

<p>It’s different for everyone, depending on your situation it can take between 3-12 months before you see a significant return on your investment. To truly reap the benefits of our service, you should be looking to invest for 6 months before evaluating renewal.</p>
