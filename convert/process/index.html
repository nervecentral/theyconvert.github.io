<h2>￼Onboarding You</h2>

<p>Once you’ve paid, we’ll:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up a Trello board for us to coordinate our activity.</li>
<li>Set up an account for us on Convert.com or Optimizely.com (or any other tool you choose to work with).</li>
<li>Set up an account on hotjar.com (we use it for surveys, polls, heatmaps, user video sessions).</li>
<li>You give us access to all the analytics tools, surveys, data you have.</li>
<li>We start research (we’ll keep you posted on our findings).</li>
<li>Set up a usertesting.com account for us to start user testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to develop a 6 month optimization plan during the first month and start testing during the second month.</p>

<p>After your first payment, your card will be automatically charged on a monthly basis. In regards to your payments:</p>

<ul>
<li>We try to keep payment as automatic as possible.</li>
<li>We use Snappy Checkout, which processes payments through Stripe, a secure and respected payment processor.</li>
<li>Let us know if you ever need to change your billing information. We’ll cancel your existing plan so it no longer bills you, and we’ll provide you a link so you can sign up with your new information.</li>
<li>Currently we don’t accept other forms of payment for Convert engagements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>￼Our Tools</h2>

<p>We’ll be using a few tools to roll out tests, make changes, and coordinate our work together.</p>

<h3>Trello</h3>

<p>We’ll use Trello to post reports, research findings, coordinate on future tests, notify each other of our availability, and critique our work together. Trello is a great email substitute, because it ensures a long-lasting, group-visible record of all our work together.</p>

<p>I’m happy to invite as many people as appropriate to Trello; just let me know their email addresses. (You can also invite them yourself.)</p>

<p>We’re happy to work with all types of client, no matter how hands-on they are. We have clients who are entirely hands-off, letting me test as needed and offering minimal feedback. We also have clients who go so far as to mark up their own screenshots. Most are somewhere in the middle, providing some feedback after they see how the work has progressed.</p>

<h3>Convert.com and Optimizely.com</h3>

<p>Unless you have your own A/B testing account, we’ll use one of our accounts at Convert.com or Optimizely.com.</p>

<p>We’ll provide screenshots of the final results for each test.</p>

<p>You’ll be required to add a snippet of JavaScript to all pages that you want to test. Please do this before we kick off our first test.</p>

<h3>Analytics tools</h3>

<p>Before we begin our first A/B test, we’d like to be granted access to your analytics tools.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can give Google Analytics access to <a href="mailto:hello@theyconvert.com">hello@theyconvert.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Access to other analytics suites (KISSmetrics, Mixpanel, Mint, etc.) also use <a href="mailto:hello@theyconvert.com">hello@theyconvert.com</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is so we can determine how your conversion funnels are working, and what pages are getting enough traffic to perform statistically significant tests. </p>

<p>We pay careful attention to your analytics as we put together tests and take action on future changes.</p>

<h3>Rolling out changes</h3>

<p>It will be your responsibility to take the changes from a winning test and implement then into your website. We will supply any designs and code we created for the test, and are happy to work closely with your team to ensure the correct changes are made.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Our Availability</h2>

<p>We work Monday through Friday, between 12pm and 10pm GMT/UTC (compare your timezone to ours). If you contact us outside of those times, we might not respond as quickly as usual.</p>

<p>If you’d like to have a chat, it’s best to book a time.</p>

<p>Like everybody, we also take vacation from time to time. Barring any personal emergencies, you’ll know about our vacation plans at least one month in advance.</p>

<p>Expect intermittent availability around most British holidays like Christmas, New Year’s, Queen’s Birthday and other public holidays.</p>

<hr>

<h2>A Few Questions You Might Have</h2>

<h4>How long will each A/B test run for?</h4>

<p>We run each test for a minimum of 3-4 weeks regardless of traffic levels and conversion rates. This provides the highest possibility that any changes (positive or negative) the test results indicate will also occur if you make the changes permanent.</p>

<h4>How many A/B test tests will I get per month?</h4>

<p>We average 1-2 tests per month. Most tests are run for 3-4 weeks to ensure valid results. The number of tests we perform each month depends on the size and changes required for each test.</p>

<h4>How long before the first A/B test is live?</h4>

<p>During the second month. The first month is set aside for our extensive research process that enables us to create more winning tests than the industry average. It takes time to fully understand your business and customers, integrate with your technology, and evaluate your analytics (or setup/fix your analytics if required).</p>

<h4>Who will write the copy or create the designs when making the changes to my website?</h4>

<p>Copywriting, design and front end coding are all included when testing. If any updates require changes to the back end we’ll discuss this with you and plan the best course of action together. You’ll be responsible for taking the changes from winning tests and making them permanent in your website (you’ll have full access to all work we’ve created).</p>

<h4>What about whole website redesigns?</h4>

<p>Whole website redesigns are not included in our monthly fee, but we do provide conversion optimized redesigns as a service and are happy to provide you with a quote.</p>

<h4>What happens when we get a positive result from an A/B test?</h4>

<p>First we give each other a round of high fives … then we start a new test while you implement the changes from the winning test permanently into your website. Optimization is an ongoing process and there are many ways to increase your sales and revenue.</p>

<h4>How long will it take before I see results?</h4>

<p>It’s different for everyone, depending on your situation it can take between 3-12 months before you see a significant return on your investment. To truly reap the benefits of our service, you should be looking to invest for 6 months before evaluating renewal.</p>

<h4>I don’t want to use Convert.com or Optimizely.com. Can we go with a different A/B testing app?</h4>

<p>Sure, but Convert comes with Convert.com or Optimizely.com for free, not any other testing framework. If you want to use a different framework or a larger plan, you’ll need to pay for and maintain it yourself. We’ll create the tests in whatever you’re happiest using, just give us access and we can take it from there.</p>

<p>Why doesn’t Convert.com or Optimizely.com’s reported data match my internal analytics?
There are a lot of technical reasons for this, which is partly why Convert.com, Optimizely.com and other A/B testing suites work in terms of statistical confidence. Tests that finish with 90% confidence still have a 10% chance of not providing some measurable improvement.</p>

<h4>Can we test mobile sites as well?</h4>

<p>Yes! We love testing mobile and responsive sites. But testing native apps is outside of scope.</p>
