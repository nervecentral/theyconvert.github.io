  <h6>Let us tell you a quick story about Emma and Larry.</h6>

<p>Both Emma and Larry sell eyewear for canines—nothing but the finest quality glasses for the most discerning of pooches.</p>

<p>They were both looking to build their businesses and become the top dog (pardon the pun) in their industry.</p>

<p>Larry decided to spend all of his budget on advertising to bring as many people as possible to his website peek-a-pooch.com.</p>

<p>Emma, on the other hand, hired two experienced (and, dare I say, handsome) CRO consultants to optimize her website designer-doggy.com and increase existing conversion rates.</p>

<p>While Larry was busy pouring money into advertising, we researched and analysed Emma’s website along with her competitors.</p>

<p>We looked at Emma’s website analytics, surveyed her customers and come up with a list of changes to A/B test to increase Emma’s sales of doggy glasses.</p>

<p>Larry’s additional advertising was paying off and he increased the number of visitors to his website from 10,000 to 20,000 per month.</p>

<p>Larry’s average sale was worth $100 and with a conversion rate of 1%, he was making one sale out of every 100 visitors to his website.</p>

<p>He’d increased his monthly revenue from what was initially $10,000 up to $20,000, but due to his additional monthly advertising costs of $5,000, he only profited $15,000 per month.</p>

<p>Emma also started with 10,000 visitors per month and that remained unchanged. But after A/B testing, her conversion rate doubled from one sale per 100 visitors to two sales per 100 visitors.</p>

<p>Now Emma was making $20,000 in revenue per month and profiting from all of it.</p>

<p>But she didn’t stop there …</p>

<p>Emma started advertising like Larry had and doubled her visitors to 20,000 per month. Emma was now making $40,000 minus her monthly advertising costs of $5,000.</p>

<p>Over the following year Emma made $420,000 in profit over Larry’s $180,000 which is not too shabby don’t you think.</p>

<p>Now … who would you rather be?</p>
